        <h3>Achievement's of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h3>
        <div id="tribute-info">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1869</strong>-Born on 2nd October in Gujarat</li>
                <li><strong>1893</strong>-Mohandas Gandhi arrived in South Africa (SA) in 1893 as a legal representative of Indian traders in Durban. He faced the prevalent discrimination against people of colour in SA and decided to take up the fight against racial oppression. At the time, the Natal Assembly was about to pass a law disqualifying voters who were not of European origin and Gandhi became the leader of the Indian community to oppose the bill. Though temporarily delayed due to his efforts, the bill was ultimately passed in 1896. However, Natal Indian Congress, found in opposition to the bill, made the Indian community in SA a unified force. Also, Gandhi soon became a prominent campaigner for rights of the Asian community in SA.</li>
                <li><strong>1914</strong>-In 1906, a law was enacted in SA which required all male Asians in the Transvaal Province to be fingerprinted and carry a form of pass. In response Gandhi started the Satyagraha (‘truth-force’) campaign of non-violent resistance. He urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer punishments for doing so. The campaign intensified in 1913 in protest against a £3 tax on ex-indentured Indians and because the state refused to recognise Indian marriages. Satyagraha was a 7 year struggle during which thousands of Indians were jailed, flogged and even shot. In 1914, due to public outcry over harsh treatment of peaceful protestors, the Indian Relief Act was passed which withdrew the £3 tax, customary marriages were recognised, and Indians were allowed to move freely into the Transvaal.</li>
                <li><strong>1918</strong>-<strong>Kheda Satyagraha</strong> In 1915, Gandhi returned to India which was under British rule then. Champaran is a district in the Indian state of Bihar. The British forced farmers in the region to grow Indigo and other cash crops instead of food crops. Farmers sold these to mostly British landlords at extremely low fixed prices. This was coupled with bad weather conditions and harsh taxes leaving the famers in abject poverty. Gandhi arrived in Champaran in April 1917. Adopting strategy of non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi led organized protests and strikes against the landlords. Finally, the British landlords signed an agreement granting more compensation and control to the farmers; and cancelling revenue hikes and collection until the famine ended. During this agitation, people began referring to Gandhi as Mahatma (Great Soul).</li>
                <li><strong>1918</strong>-In 1918, Kheda district in Gujarat, India was hit by floods and famine, leading to crop yields being less than a fourth. However, British government refused requests by the peasants for relief from taxes. Aided by the future Home Minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi initiated a campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue though the government threated to confiscate their land and warned that seized property wouldn’t be returned. Even with their property seized by the British government, majority of the farmers stood behind Patel and Gandhi. After five months, in May 1918, the government suspended the tax for that year and the next, the increase in rate was reduced and all confiscated property was returned.</li>
                <li><strong>1930</strong>-<strong>Salt March </strong> The British Salt Act of 1882 prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt and also imposed a heavy tax on it. In 1930, for 24 days from 12th March to 6th April, Mahatma Gandhi marched 388 kilometres (241 mi) from Ahmedabad to Dandi, in Gujarat, to produce salt from seawater, as was the practice of local populace until the British Salt Act. Thousands of Indians joined him in this famous Salt March, or Dandi March. It sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against British salt laws by millions of Indians leading to 80,000 Indians being jailed. Though it didn’t lead to any concessions, Salt March was extensively covered by media and the world began to recognize the legitimacy of Indian claim for independence. The March to Dandi would later influence several activists including Martin Luther King, Jr.</li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong>-<strong>Quit India Movement </strong>After World War II started, Gandhi declared that India could not be party to a war being supposedly fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He launched the Quit India Movement on 8th August 1942 demanding an end to British Rule in India. He made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech. Almost the entire leadership of Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of his speech. Despite lack of leadership, large protests and demonstrations were held all over the country. The British made over 100,000 arrests and hundreds were killed. Though Quit India Movement was successfully supressed by the British, they realized it was now impossible to rule India. At the end of Second World War, British indicated that power would soon be transferred to India. Gandhi called off the struggle and around 100,000 political prisoners were released.</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong>-<strong>Indian Independence Movement </strong>Mahatma Gandhi was the most prominent leader of the Indian Independence movement and he is unofficially referred to as ‘Father of the Nation’ in India. India gained its independence on 15th August 1947 but it was accompanied by partition of British India into sovereign states of India and Pakistan. This led to widespread riots in the region in which an estimated 200,000 to 2,000,000 people were killed. Mahatma Gandhi appealed to all for peace. In Calcutta, where he was present, he took a fast at the age of 77, which ameliorated the situation in the region. Without his presence, there could have perhaps been even more bloodshed during the partition.</li>
                <li><strong>HE FOUGHT AGAINST SOCIAL EVILS IN SOCIETY LIKE UNTOUCHABILITY</strong><br>Apart from his fight against Britain, Mahatma Gandhi worked on a number of social issues in India. He launched campaigns to improve the lives of untouchables, or lower caste people. His efforts were important in the practice of Untouchability being ultimately discontinued. Gandhi strongly favoured emancipation of women. He opposed the practices of child marriage; oppression of widows; and purdah/burqa, which is women covering their faces in public. He was also successful in enlisting women in his campaigns, including salt tax campaign, anti-untouchability campaign and the peasant movement. This increased the participation of women in Indian public life.</li>
                <li><strong>1948</strong>-At 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into his chest from a pistol at close range.</lli>
